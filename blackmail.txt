This email is autogenerated by BYU-Idontcare.     This is your final warning. You have been caught slacking on your work, and your punishment is going to be 'crushingly hard.' Keep in mind that this is not a joke.     Most of you are probably already aware of the drill. If you have done this kind of thing in the past, you may have suffered a good hard lecture in which my supervisor is not terribly impressed with your insubordination and tells you you are being punished accordingly.     For those of you that were unaware, here is a list of the punishments you will receive for your infractions:     - Do the math
Your time ends now old man.     The path to the grave is now cleared for as I got to my house I received a call that there was a plane crash.     I didn't know it was a plane crash until I saw it on the news.     So, all those that live in this plane crash community, thank you for an amazing ride.
You are facing several charges of perjury, infringing on others rights, and using a computer to commit crime.     This was what we thought we were fighting for, but somehow, you managed to get away with it.     We believe you committed the crimes of breaking into the computer of the child to retrieve information, and all the crimes above, in order to convince the defendant that the truth was in fact false.     It seems that you lied your way through the investigation and even the trial, and the Judge himself believed you.     You lied in court and to your parents, saying they were just supporting you and were out to ruin your name.     You did not even have a reason to do that, or a good reason.     We were all just trying to find the truth and nothing more.     You had to have an ulterior motive.     But you do not seem to care what people think of you.     I do.     And the Judge does.     He knew the truth, and he had his guard up.     We trusted him.     Even when we knew he could be biased.     But he was in fact biased.     Your lies fell on deaf ears.    Not that the Judge cares.
