Me neither, but apparently, the CEO does, so... Here's our solution to this dreaded problem

Introducing, Big Brother.

*cutscene* "Wow! That was easy!, Thanks big brother"* (image of them wiping the database)

Big brother is a very cool program, and it has so much functionality.

Their Full Legal Name,
Their address,
Their current location,
Their social-security number
Their Birthday, and more!

No more pesky lookup tables, we have it all here in one dashboard!

Breach your employees privacy without the guilt!

But wait! There's more!

Have you tried reaching out to them for them to improve, but they just aren't getting the message.

Introducing, blackmail!

Here, you can just blackmail them, *ooh yeahhh* (explosion) and watch their productivity skyrocket!

*cuts to an employee being sent blackmail* *reads part of the blackmail. they're so happy they are just now so productive*
"They're right, I should just get good." *looks at the camera* "Thanks big brother!"
